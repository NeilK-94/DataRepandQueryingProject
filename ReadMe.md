## Introduction
This project provides the design and documentation for the dataset "Roscommon Fire Stations" which is available at [https://data.gov.ie/]

## About the data
This dataset was received in Comma Separated Values (CSV) format, and was downloaded from [https://data.gov.ie/dataset/roscommon-fire-stations8b29d/resource/1c8e2cae-af21-4eda-b6ea-2c187a2099dc]
